# How to play FizzBuzz

1. Your current number is 1.
2. If your current number is divisible by 3, say "fizz".
3. If your current number is divisible by 5, say "buzz".
   (Note that this means that you'll say "fizz" and "buzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5.)
4. Increase your current number by 1.
5. Go back to step 2.

Keep counting until you make a mistake. See if you can beat your high score! Or your friends' high scores! Or your enemies! And their high scores, too!

(Oh stars, I have no idea what number I'm looking for. I think it was the 37? Which means this is 39, and it's supposed... to be a fizz or a buzz?)
(So this works... maybe... if I understand the check.)
